They treated the house and subsequently scheduled a handful of more visits to make sure the problem was fixed. He then even worked with my maintenance guy to make sure everyone was on the same page about the necessary repairs to make sure the problem doesn't arise again in the future. I highly recommend On Target Pest Control.",5.0,LEGITIMATE,0.0,

7,"Incredible customer service. I’ve ordered a couple of swimsuits and dresses from this site. I recently ordered a jumper for my daughter and I to match. However I just didn’t like how the jumper looked on my post pregnancy body. So I contacted customer service to see if I could return it for store credit. He told me I could keep the items, and he would give me a full refund! JEFFREY did an incredible job making my life easier.

10,"The clothes are well- made. Especially the ones I bought that are for winter ( very thick and has 80% cotton) This is my first time buying from them and I am very satisfied with their baby clothing . They are super cute ! ( they do run a little big but I’m sure it’s better if it’s bigger than smaller. ) I did have one accessory item that I was not very satisfy with as it had a little stain on it. However their customer service was excellent and refunded me the money and told me to avoid the hassle of returning the item. Good customer service does go a long way, as I know if I ever buy an item that I’m not satisfied with I will always be covered as I can return the item. I really recommend them. Will continue to buy baby clothes from them for sure.",5.0,LEGITIMATE,0.0,

18,"Used Bellhop for an out of state move to D.C. After getting quotes and reading reviews for 4 companies, Bellhop was the most affordable and most consistently highly reviewed of the set. They have a bit of a tech start up feel with centralized customer service that is frequent and responsive, and locally sourced teams for loading and driving. Unloading after an out of state move in Washington DC went great.  Yannick, Lamar and Michael were professional, quick and efficient in unloading the materials, setting up furniture and helping to make the final stage of the move low stress. Thank you!",5.0,LEGITIMATE,0.0,

20,"First I want to say that the assistance and support I received, particularly as a new customer from ADM and from the owner and founder, Mr. Anthony Davoli won me over instantly, it was absolutely amazing.  I have the CG5 dual clamp installed on my ASGT CG5 mount holding my Celestron 9.25 SCT.  It is a major upgrade to my rig and is a well thought out, well manufactured, brilliant piece of engineering.  I even noticed improved GoTo accuracy from object to object.  It looks like some shifting was occurring with the original clamp screw/bolt that created a hole or indentation in the CG5 rail.  When the scope was moved to different positions it is possible that, even if tightened down, the weight of the tube moved the end of the clamping bolt in the hole on the CG5 rail.  A slight shift is all it would take to miss the GoTo mark enough to move the object further from the center of FOV, especially  at high magnification.  It is a dramatic improvement, of course in addition to safely, evenly and firmly holding my telescope onto the mount with zero damage to my new CGE D series rail.  It it so versatile with the capability of using my other Newtonians that still have the narrow CG5 Vixen rail.  I feel relieved now knowing that my investment will not fall off and hit the ground, it is so rock-solid.  Also, it is much easier to hold my scope up with one arm while laying the dovetail bar in the ADM groove and quickly  being able to tighten the 2 inch knobs that grip the rail fast and secure.  Such a critical operation is now so much simpler.  Interestingly, with the CGE rail the OTA now sits up higher off the ground allowing me to collapse the tripod legs to lower the focuser height.  This in itself makes the tripod safer to use, it is much more stable.  After looking at several popular options, there is no comparison to the ADM product, hands down.",5.0,LEGITIMATE,0.0,

51,On my 3rd device in just a little over a month... first one didn’t hit right every time and i exchanged it where i got it. The second lasted a little over a month before the draw function wasn’t recognized.. charging and pod recognition was fine. I ordered a new device because i really like the pod flavors and have a ton to vape. I am in the process of exchanging through the company for my 3rd rose gold device because it’s outside the retailers return policy. I hope i don’t have an issue with the company honoring the return and swapping it out. But for now i have my new device in a different color and it works ok and is doing its job but I’ve only been using it for a few hours.
